This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:


After download 
```bash
run
npm -i
to install nextjs 

npm run dev 
for the development server

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To see each pages 
First page :http://localhost:3000
Second page :http://localhost:3000/Signin
Third page :http://localhost:3000/Signup
Fourth page :http://localhost:3000/Homescreen
Fifth page :http://localhost:3000/Menu
 
Please some of the links are functional 
For example the Home and Explore buttons are functional on the Navbar and leads to thier respective pages.
Not all but some.
I just made those links just to show which pages which are currently available.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Problems Encountered
For the icons I installed Iconsax-reactjs and Lucide-react (check package-lock.json) and i couldn't get them to work or find solution for them but you will see, I wrote their codes and commmented it.

I had problems with importing images at first because of the turbo server, thats why you see some images in "@/componets/page 1"

## Note 
The average phone width is 720p, if use the inspect function of chrome/firefox the minimum width is 320p which I find impossible to
to find as at the time this project was done, to check the project on small media such as phones I suggest using the deployment link stated above. 

## Personal Note 
Ignore the useState error in navbar, it has an existential crisis of it own
While writing this code to be honest, it has been a long time I write in Nextjs. I was worried about how it would come out 
because apperently a lot of things have changed while I was away but I am glad it worked out in the end with the help of many.

 WELL THANK YOU FOR READING, I HOPE YOU DO MORE WITH IT.
